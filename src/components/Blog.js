                      Authentication is the act of validating that users are

                      the user permission to access a specific resource or
                      function. This term is often used interchangeably with
                      access control or client privilege.

                      the same way that a system only grants access to users who

                      authentication when someone wants to access the
                      information, and the server needs to know who is accessing
                      the information. The client uses it when he wants to know
                      that it is the same server that it claims to be.

                you have access to basic profile information like photourl,
                email, e.t.c. You can also use the provided authentication token
                to verify the identity of users in your own backend services.
                Also, you can monitor your users’ behavioral pattern with
                analytics to deliver a more personalized experience.This is the
                advantage with any Baas platform like Firebase. You can roll out
                an MVP without many backend implementation worries.
